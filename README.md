# python-dataviz
For a final project during the course M.Sc Life Science Informatics, I performed 3 types of data visualisation using python. I worked in a Jupyter notebook to visualise the (fictional) signals of 4 RNA binding proteins. This assignment also required appropriate annotation of the code, as well as appropriately formatted markdown. The goal was to construct visualisations equivalent to those available on a genome browser. The assignment also consisted of the summarisation of an article on data visualisation, to be presented in appropriately-formatted markdown.
